## üåç Project Overview

India‚Äôs spiritual heritage draws millions of devotees to temples such as **Somnath**, **Dwarka**, **Ambaji**, and **Pavagadh**. These locations face massive crowd surges during festivals and weekends, leading to overcrowding, long queues, safety risks, and emergency response issues.

**TirthSuraksha** is a smart, AI-driven crowd management system designed to ensure **safe darshan**, **efficient crowd monitoring**, and **better pilgrim experience** through digital tools and IoT integration.

## üéØ Purpose

The goal of this project is to develop a **technology-based, scalable, and user-friendly solution** to manage temple crowds efficiently. It integrates **AI crowd prediction**, **IoT surveillance**, and **real-time communication** for both devotees and temple authorities.

## üß© Problem Statement

Current manual crowd control methods at pilgrimage sites often fail to manage large-scale gatherings effectively.  
Key issues include:

- Overcrowding and long waiting queues  
- Lack of real-time crowd visibility and communication  
- Poor traffic and parking management  
- Limited emergency preparedness  
- Inaccessible facilities for elderly and differently-abled devotees

4. **Emergency Response Module**
   - Panic alerts, SOS system, and nearest aid mapping.
5. **Authority Dashboard**
   - Admin panel for crowd, facility, and gate zone management.
6. **Pilgrim Portal**
   - Devotee login for viewing temple status, crowd density, and slot booking.
7. **Accessibility Support**
